- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jbucien, an undergraduate student at Oregon State University. I'm currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science, with an expected graduation date of Spring 2023. 
- :sunny: Last summer (2022), I was a Technical Writing Intern at Salesforce. For my internship project, I wrote a guide examining the conceptual differences between centralized and distributed version control systems. The guide is specifically aimed at technical writers whose companies are transitioning from VCS such as Perforce to Git/GitHub.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: how to create effective technical documentation for software developers; utilizing knowledge of computer science principles in technical writing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Python, C, JavaScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennabucien/)
